### In this project i created a api for a store 

### for data persistence i used mongodb with docker and used volumes 

### to run this app first you should have docker installed then go to your terminal and clone this repository then if you have docker installed you can build image by typing docker build -t <image_name>:<version> if you don't want to change the Dockerfile write image_name and version as "store-api:1.0" then run docker-compose up and if you want to run it in detached mode add flag -d
